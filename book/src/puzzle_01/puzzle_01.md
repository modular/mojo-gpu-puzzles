# Puzzle 1: Map

## Overview

This puzzle introduces the fundamental concept of GPU parallelism: mapping individual threads to data elements for concurrent processing.
Your task is to implement a kernel that adds 10 to each element of vector `a`, storing the results in vector `output`.

**Note:** _You have 1 thread per position._

## Key concepts

- Basic GPU kernel structure
- One-to-one thread to data mapping
- Memory access patterns
- Array operations on GPU

For each position \\(i\\):
\\[\Large output[i] = a[i] + 10\\]
