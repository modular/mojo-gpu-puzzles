# Puzzle 12: Dot Product

## Overview

Implement a kernel that computes the dot product of vector `a` and vector `b` and stores it in `output` (single number).  The dot product is an operation that takes two vectors of the same size and returns a single number (a scalar). It is calculated by multiplying corresponding elements from each vector and then summing those products.

For example, if you have two vectors:

\\[a = [a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}] \\]
\\[b = [b_{1}, b_{2}, ..., b_{n}] \\]

‚ÄãTheir dot product is:
\\[a \\cdot b = a_{1}b_{1} +  a_{2}b_{2} + ... + a_{n}b_{n}\\]

**Note:** _You have 1 thread per position. You only need 2 global reads per thread and 1 global write per thread block._
